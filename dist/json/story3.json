Two weeks later he married Mitchell and they headed&nbsp;west so he could try out for the Eskimos.<\/p>  <p><\/p>  <p><\/p>  <p>The couple had four sons, and during his football career Getty&nbsp;went on to win two Grey Cups.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>He was hired by Imperial Oil a week after he arrived in Edmonton, and started his own oil and gas company&nbsp;nine years later.<\/p>  <p>[IMAGE]<\/p>  <p>Getty entered provincial politics after Peter Lougheed&nbsp;encouraged him to run for the PCs in the 1967 provincial election. Getty was elected in the Edmonton riding of Strathcona West, joining<\/p>  <p>Lougheed as one of the so-called Original Six&nbsp;Tory MLAs.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>In 1971, the Tories under Lougheed won their first majority government, defeating the Social Credit Party, which had been in power for 36 years.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>Getty was appointed federal and intergovernmental affairs minister; he also served as energy minister. He left politics in 1979 but&nbsp;was drawn back into the political spotlight&nbsp;six years later, when he successfully ran to replace Lougheed as premier and party leader.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>Around that time, Getty learned from his predecessor what could lie ahead.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>\"And [Lougheed]&nbsp;said, 'Well, Don, if oil stays at $30 a barrel, you are going to lose $2-1\/2 billion your first year,'\" Getty recalled in November 2012.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>\"I said, 'Peter, what the hell?' And, he said, 'If it drops to $10, we're all going to be broke.' \"<\/p>  <p><span>[MEDIA]<\/span><\/p>  <p><span>\u200B<\/span>Getty led the Tories to a victory in 1986, his party winning 61 of 83 seats. But almost as soon as he took over, a global oil glut saw prices&nbsp;plunge by 60 per cent. Alberta's economy tanked and the province was saddled with what at that time was a record&nbsp;$3.3-billion deficit. Five more deficits followed and the&nbsp;accumulated debt eventually topped $15 billion \u2014 about $3 billion more than the&nbsp;assets of the nest-egg Heritage Savings Trust Fund.<\/p>  <p>Getty's&nbsp;government pumped billions of&nbsp;dollars into oil and forestry initiatives, new pulp mills, loans and&nbsp;sweetheart incentives to encourage drilling.&nbsp;But problems mounted and he&nbsp;was blamed for the failure of a number of government-backed&nbsp;businesses, the most costly of which was a $600-million loss on a&nbsp;cellular phone company called NovAtel Communications.<\/p>  <h2>'A temporary set back'<\/h2>  <p>The Tories won another huge majority in March 1989, but in that election&nbsp;Getty&nbsp;lost his own&nbsp;Edmonton-Whitemud&nbsp;seat to Liberal Percy&nbsp;Wickman.<\/p>  <p>[IMAGE]&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>A Tory MLA in the rural riding of Stettler stepped down, which allowed Getty to win the subsequent byelection that&nbsp;May.<\/p>  <p>In a bid to make the Senate more effective,&nbsp;Getty&nbsp;held the first&nbsp;senator-in waiting election in 1989. The winning candidate, Stan&nbsp;Waters, was appointed to the upper chamber a year later by&nbsp;then-prime minister Brian&nbsp;Mulroney.<\/p>  <p>Getty&nbsp;had a rocky relationship with&nbsp;Mulroney. He backed&nbsp;Mulroney's&nbsp;bid for a free-trade deal with the United States but&nbsp;railed against the imposition of the GST in 1991.&nbsp;He fought for the&nbsp;Meech&nbsp;Lake and Charlottetown accords to embrace&nbsp;Quebec in the Canadian constitutional fold.<\/p>  <p>\"The greatest thing to me is to have tried,\" he said after the&nbsp;Charlottetown pact went down to defeat. \"Perhaps it doesn't always&nbsp;work out, but not to have tried, now that would have been&nbsp;terrible.\"<\/p>  <p>Getty resigned as premier in 1992.<\/p>  <p>He mostly stayed out of the public spotlight after he left office.&nbsp;He became an officer of the Order of Canada in 1998.<\/p>  <p>In September 2012, Getty paid his respects as&nbsp;Lougheed&nbsp;lay in state at the Alberta Legislature. His political colleague was 84 when he died.<\/p>  <h2>Principal Group collapse, Gainers loan&nbsp;<\/h2>  <p>Many Albertans will remember Getty for creating the February Family Day holiday, making Alberta the first Canadian province to do so.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>In a November 2012 interview, Getty said that he faced some opposition from his own government over the holiday, which he proposed as a way to support family values.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>\"It took a while, because there were some of my own cabinet who said, 'Oh, come on, Family Day?'&nbsp;\" Getty said. \"And I said, 'Look, you son of a bitch, we are having a Family Day.' \"<\/p>  <p>On the national stage, Getty played a key role in constitutional talks and was a proponent of the Triple E Senate - \"elected, equal, effective.\"<\/p>  <p>His time in office was marked by the collapse of Edmonton-based investment firm Principal Group, which led to $457 million in losses for 67,000 investors.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>[PHOTOGALLERY]<\/p>  <p>He came under heavy criticism around that time when he was photographed on a golf course after an assistant said that he was \"working out of office.\"<\/p>  <p>An inquiry chaired by lawyer Bill Code resulted in a report that blamed the provincial government for failing to provide proper oversight of investment firms.<\/p>  <p>Getty's government also lent Peter Pocklington $67 million in cash and loan guarantees for the Gainers meat-packing plant in Edmonton.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>The province took over the plant in 1989 after Pocklington defaulted on the loan and sold it several years later, after racking up millions in losses.&nbsp;<\/p>  <h2>Proud of role in oilsands&nbsp;<\/h2>  <p>Looking back on his career as a cabinet minister and premier, Getty said he was proudest of the role he played in developing Alberta's resource industry as energy minister in the 1970s.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>Getty helped put together the deal that led to the construction of the Syncrude plant.<\/p>  <p>\"I was determined to build an oilsands plant,\" Getty said.&nbsp;\"And now those oilsands are the greatest thing on Earth \u2026 they will be and Alberta will be the centre of them.\"&nbsp;<\/p>    <blockquote class=\"pullquote\">  <span class=\"pullquote-quotation\">'I believe he was a true Canadian who wanted to keep this country united.'<\/span>  <cite class=\"pullquote-source\">-&nbsp;Jim Horseman, former Alberta deputy premier<\/cite> <\/blockquote>    <p>Getty also reflected on his decision to approve $100 million for the construction of the City Centre Campus of Grant MacEwan College that centralized operations in downtown Edmonton.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>\"It was just an old, dirty railroad track there, and I was determined, even my cabinet resisted, because it's when I lost the Whitemud seat,\" he said.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>Getty resisted those calls because he believed that building the campus, now the home of MacEwan University, was the right thing to do.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>\"You could see the impact of cleaning that area up and now this magnificent university,\" he said.&nbsp;<\/p>  <p>[MEDIA]<\/p>  <h2>'He was pretty selfless'<\/h2>  <p>Former Alberta deputy premier and close family friend Jim Horsman said Getty managed to steer Albertans through a historic collapse in oil prices, \"not an unfamiliar thing for Albertans to deal with,\" he said.<\/p>  <p>\"I believe he was a true Canadian who wanted to keep this country united,\" Horsman said.<\/p>  <p>\"But all in all I think he was a good Canadian and I think he was a gentleman.
